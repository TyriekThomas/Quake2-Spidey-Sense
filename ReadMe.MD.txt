      The next weapon mode in the player’s inventory is the WEBPuller which is a weapon used to grab and pull enemies and bring them to a closer range for the player. This WEBpuller can be used to capture the bad guys, literally.


      This final weapon is the heavy duty WEBShooter which inflicts damage and repels the enemy far away. This comes in handy for handling multiple enemies at once.
