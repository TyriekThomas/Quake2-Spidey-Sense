_//* Readme.txt for the Quake II: Spidey Mod
The main emphasis of this mod is to port over the many abilities and features of Marvel’s Spiderman character. Fundamentally the game is no longer just an RPG shooting franchise, The Spidey MOD for Quake II integrates a Spidey Rescue Mission storyline with the goal of rescuing as many people as possible.//*

_//* There is one main stable in the player’s inventory called the WEB and the WEB weapon has three different modes. The default mode is self titled and allows the main Spidey character to WEB around the level and quickly get to unreachable locations.
  

      The next weapon mode in the player’s inventory is the WEBPuller which is a weapon used to grab and pull enemies and bring them to a closer range for the player. This WEBpuller can be used to capture the bad guys, literally.

      This final weapon is the heavy duty WEBShooter which inflicts damage and repels the enemy far away. This comes in handy for handling multiple enemies at once.
